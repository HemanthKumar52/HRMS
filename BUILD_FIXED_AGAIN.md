# Build Fixed: Syntax Error Resolved ✅

## 🔧 Issue
**Error:** `Error: Can't find ']' to match '['.` in `attendance_screen.dart`
**Cause:** Missing closing bracket `]` for the `circles` list in the `CircleLayer` widget on the map.

## 🛠️ Fix Applied
- Added the missing `]` closing bracket.
- Verified the structure of `CircleLayer` and `PolylineLayer`.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Please run the app again:
```bash
flutter run
```

The app should now build successfully with the new **In-App Routing** feature!
